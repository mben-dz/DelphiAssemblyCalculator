 Delphi 🚀 Mastering Inline Assembly: Build a High-Performance Calculator with Pure ASM ! 💻✨
# 🔥 Welcome to this hands-on Delphi Assembly tutorial! 🔥

In this video, we dive deep into writing high-performance mathematical operations using Inline Assembly in Delphi! 🚀 We'll build a fully functional calculator capable of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division using pure x86 assembly inside Delphi.

## 🛠 What You’ll Learn in This Video:
✅ Understanding Delphi’s Inline Assembly (`asm` block)  
✅ How to perform basic arithmetic operations (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`) in ASM  
✅ Working with CPU registers (`EAX`, `EBX`, `EDX`) for efficient computation  
✅ Using the FPU (Floating Point Unit) for precise division operations  
✅ Handling Division by Zero exceptions with clean Delphi error handling  
✅ Proper memory management with integer-to-floating point conversions  
✅ Best practices for writing clean, structured, and optimized assembly code
